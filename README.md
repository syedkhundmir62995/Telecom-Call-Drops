# Predicting-the-Percentage-of-Telecom-Call-Drops
### Project Details:
- Telecom industry builds, maintains and operates telecommunication network and thereby makes communication possible globally for us. In India, there are variety of network providers like Airtel, Idea, Vodafone, Aircel, Jio and Reliance. Due to rapid development of the internet and the evolving of 3G, 4G, and even 5G connections, telecommunication companies face the challenge of the constantly changing customer requirements. The subscribers are becoming more and more demanding, and the traffic gets more active every day.Customers tend to search for better and cheaper services therefore it is important for the telecommunication companies to measure, manage and predict the network performance and traffic optimization. Failing to predict this value may result in profit loss.

### Opportunity:
- Every customer expects to have a stable network during the call and they are often disappointed because of call drops. A call drop is a situation where a call is disconnected before the caller ends the call. Some of the main reasons for call drops are:
Inadequate coverage, which can be due to multiple reasons:
-- Lack of tower infrastructure
-- Improper network planning
-- Non-optimization of network traffic
•	Overloaded cell towers – the number of subscribers grow each day and most of them are on smartphones. The network capacity is simply not being ramped up at the same pace, which results in overloaded networks.
•	Cityscape changes – there have been instances where newly-built multi-storied buildings cause adjacent building’s subscribers to lose cell reception. Such instances are very common with rapidly changing cityscapes and calls for routine network data analysis from service providers.
•	Switching between towers – this situation occurs when a person is traveling or moving around while talking. Chances of a dropped call increase if a call handover takes place (transfer from one base transceiver station (BTS) to another), especially in the case of overloaded networks.
•	Technical failures – this is beyond anyone's control and operators generally monitor down-times through well-equipped network operation centers.

### Approach:
- This project aims to create a model to predict percentage of call drops, trained on the real time data. Looking into historical data and predicting possible future problems like estimating the network issues which may result in heavy call drops is a great benefit for the telecom providers. As a benefit to telecom providers and their customers, it can be used to identify issues at an earlier stage, allowing more time to take the necessary measures to mitigate problems. Four models were used for the prediction of which one with the best accuracy was selected.

### Results:
- We used the r2 score as our measurement metric and achieved an accuracy of 88% on the test data and 86% on validation data.
